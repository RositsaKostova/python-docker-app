# Contributors Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the project! ðŸŽ‰ Whether you're contributing to bug fixes, new features, or documentation, weâ€™re excited to have you. This guide outlines the rules and workflows that should be followed to ensure smooth collaboration and high-quality code contributions.

## Branching Strategy

In our project, we follow a **branching strategy** to keep our workflow organized and maintainable. Here's how we manage our branches:

### 1. **Main Branch (`main`)**
- The `main` branch represents the **production-ready** state of the code.
- Only thoroughly reviewed, tested, and stable code should be merged into `main`.
- All releases are created from the `main` branch.

### 2. **Development Branch (`develop`)**
- The `develop` branch contains the latest **stable** development changes.
- New features and bug fixes should be integrated into `develop` before being merged into `main`.
- All developers must create feature branches from `develop`.

### 3. **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**
- Feature branches are used to work on new features or changes.
- Each new feature should have its own dedicated branch.
- Feature branch names should follow this format: `feature/[feature-name]` (e.g., `feature/login-page`).
- Feature branches should always be created from `develop`.
- When the feature is complete, create a pull request (PR) to merge it into `develop`.

### 4. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)**
- Hotfix branches are for fixing critical bugs in the `main` branch (production).
- These branches should be created directly from `main` and must be merged back into both `main` and `develop`.
- Hotfix branches should follow this format: `hotfix/[issue-name]` (e.g., `hotfix/fix-404-error`).

### 5. **Release Branches (`release/*`)**
- Release branches are used for preparing the next production release.
- These branches allow for testing, bug fixing, and final adjustments before deployment.
- Create a release branch from `develop` when you're ready for a release (e.g., `release/v1.0`).
- After testing, merge the release branch into both `main` and `develop` to ensure everything is up to date.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

### Opening a PR
- Always open a pull request when you want to merge your changes into `develop` or `main`.
- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the base branch (either `develop` or `main`) before opening a PR.
- Include a detailed description of the changes, why they were made, and how to test them.

### Code Review
- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before being merged.
- Reviewers should focus on:
  - Code readability and maintainability.
  - Correctness and functionality.
  - Performance considerations.
  - Following the project's style guide.

### Merging a PR
- Once a PR has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged.
- Always **merge** your PR using the **merge commit** (not squash or rebase) to preserve history.
- **Do not merge your own PR**. It must be reviewed by someone else.
- After merging, delete the feature or hotfix branch to keep the repository clean.

## Conflict Resolution

### Resolving Conflicts
- If you encounter merge conflicts, **resolve them locally** before submitting the PR.
- Communicate with your team if you need help resolving conflicts, especially if they involve multiple files or complex logic.

### Best Practices for Avoiding Conflicts
- Frequently **pull** from `develop` or `main` to keep your branch up to date.
- When possible, break up your changes into smaller, manageable PRs.
- Avoid making large changes to files that are actively being worked on by others.

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### Code Style
- Please follow the Python **PEP 8** style guide for all code contributions.
- Run **flake8** on your code before submitting a PR to check for common style issues and errors.

### Documentation
- Update the documentation (if applicable) for any new features, changes, or bug fixes.
- If you add new functions or classes, please include docstrings that follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

### Tests
- Always write **unit tests** for new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure all existing tests pass by running `pytest` before opening a PR.
- Add test cases to cover edge cases and scenarios that could break the code.

## Workflow Summary

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`.
2. Implement the feature or fix.
3. Push your branch and open a pull request to `develop`.
4. Your pull request will be reviewed, and you may need to make changes based on feedback.
5. Once approved, merge your PR into `develop`.
6. If necessary, create a release branch from `develop` for testing.
7. Merge the release branch into `main` for deployment.

## Conclusion

Thank you for contributing! Together, we can maintain a smooth, organized development process and ensure high-quality code. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the team. Happy coding! ðŸš€
